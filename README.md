# Live Sketching Application

We live in an increasingly digital world where information is always right at our fingertips. We expect it to be fast, high quality, and convenient. Perhaps more than anything, our digital world means more and more information is being presented in a visual format Live Sketching software allows users to create a drawing with digital graphics. Instead of traditional art supplies such as paper and pen, artists create drawings on a computer or tablet using digital tools such as brush sets, color palettes, and more. These drawings can range from 2D drafts that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed to digital artwork. In this project report, we have built a python-opencv program to make live sketch from the webcam live feed.
